**Logging in**: The test will log in using the credentials of the designated user.

**Navigating to Addresses**: Upon successful login, the test will navigate to the Addresses section by clicking on the respective tile.

**Creating a New Address:** Once on the Addresses page, the test will initiate the creation of a new address by clicking on the "+ Create new address" button.

**Completing the New Address Form:** The test will fill out the New Address form with the data provided in the Examples table within the Gherkin feature file. This data includes: alias, address, city, zip/postal code, country, and phone number.

**Validating the Added Address:** Upon successful submission of the form, the test will verify the correctness of the added address data. This validation will be performed using [assertions](https://github.com/maciej-siciarski/maciej-siciarski/blob/main/Attachements/Assertions%20JUnit.png) from the JUnit library.

**Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome of this test is the successful execution of all steps outlined above, culminating in the creation of a new address with accurately inputted data.
