**Navigating to Addresses**: Upon successful login, the test will navigate to the Addresses section by clicking on the respective tile.

**Creating a New Address:** Once on the Addresses page, the test will initiate the creation of a new address by clicking on the "+ Create new address" button.

This validation will be performed using [assertions](https://github.com/maciej-siciarski/maciej-siciarski/blob/main/Attachements/Assertions%20JUnit.png) from the JUnit library.

**Expected Outcome:** The expected outcome of this test is the successful execution of all steps outlined above, culminating in the creation of a new address with accurately inputted data.
